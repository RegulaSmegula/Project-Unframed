# Project-Unframed
Game project Unframed. A museum trapped between realms. Physicals puzzles and a mysterious narrative.

CURRENT LARGE ISSUE:
This repo's voicelines don't work because of naming issue, this will be fixed.

Code:
programming work can be found in the assets folder and the scripts folder within the assets folder.
Everything was written by me except for the code for the main menu and all its submenus.

Sources:
Things used since this was my first time working in C#.
